# 🐍 Drake's Snake Game (Pygame)

A fun little **Snake Game** built with **Python** and **Pygame**.  
Unlike the classic rectangle-only snake, this version uses a apple 🍎 as the favorite food of the circle ball shaped snake.

## 🎮 Features
- Classic Snake gameplay
- Food is represented with a Apple 🍎
- Simple, beginner-friendly codebase
- Current Score, Level and Highest Score is available
- Play-again / quit option after game over
